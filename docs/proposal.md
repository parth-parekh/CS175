## Summary
Our idea for the project is to allow a user input for an item in Minecraft and have the agent traverse the world and collect resources to craft inputted item. In terms of expandability for our project, we can also allow users to make their inputs through images. The goal of our project is to mimic a fully functioning Minecraft player with an object to craft in mind through specific resource gathering.

## AI/ML Algorithms
For our project, we anticipate the usage of reinforcement learning with neural function approximator to allow the agent to observe, traverse, and interact with the world. If we choose to implement the image input system, we will also require deep learning for image classification.

## Evaluation Plan
In terms of quantitative evaluation, one metric we will analyze is the number of correct resources gathered to craft inputted item. Another metric that is important is the time taken by the agent to traverse the world and gather all necessary resources. Finally, a third quantitative metric we plan to use is the distance the agent travels.

For the qualitative evaluation, we will use increasingly complex items to benchmark the progress and efficiency of the AI agent. For example, the most basic item would be a crafting table, which requires a small number of resources that are abundantly available, making this relatively easy to craft. It would be very impressive if our agent was able to craft rare and complex items, such as a diamond pickaxe.
