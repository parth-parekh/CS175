An AI Project in Minecraft by Gaurav Deshmukh, Parth Parekh, and Vinayak Nadig

This project is designed to develop an agent, through reinforcement learning, to traverse a default world of Minecraft and craft items as inputted by the user. The agent will be able to traverse the world collecting resources and then crafting items in order to create the specified item. We plan on implementing a user friendly interface to recieve the user input. As of now, the agent is able to create all of the wooden items and tools, and we plan on being able to include functionality for stone and iron items.
