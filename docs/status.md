## Project Summary
Our idea for the project is to allow a user input for an item in Minecraft and have the agent traverse the world and collect resources to craft inputted item. In terms of expandability for our project, we can also allow users to make their inputs through images. The goal of our project is to mimic a fully functioning Minecraft player with an object to craft in mind through specific resource gathering.

## Remaining Goals and Challenges
Our remaining 
Goals: Allow the agent to interact with the world without restrcitions. The agent should be able to craft tools which requires obtaining rarer resources; wood, stone, iron. Update the mission schema to progressively reward the agent for building tools with rarer resources. 

What we need to do : Create a mission list, continue experimenting with items of harder difficulty, We want the agent to be able to obtain the necessary resoucres to craft wood tools, then stone tools, then iron tools. 

Limitations of the Prototype: Can only obtain wooden items, cannot interact with water, no flexible way to assign new missions. We want the agent to be able to obtain wood tools, then stone tools, then iron tools. 

Challenges: Implementing image processing to identify items to create.
